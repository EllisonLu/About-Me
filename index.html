      <h2>Background info</h2>
      <p> I grew up in the Lower East Side of New York City, a small but lively community. I lived here for my entire life and when Iâ€™m asked about my childhood, the first thing that comes to mind is the Lower East Side and Chinatown. At an young age I loved technology and was thrilled at what technology can do. I remember when I was about 10 years old I used to tear apart objects around the house like watches, clocks and more. I remember in sixth grade when I received my first every phone, the Iphone 4s, I was full of excitement and joy. I got it as a birthday present and there were no words to describe how thrilled I was to start using the phone. I am currently a senior at The Manhattan Early College School for Advertising (MECA).
